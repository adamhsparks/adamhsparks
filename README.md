[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/3ed1df89-8a1a-4691-b3ec-1a955430535c/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/adamhsparks/deploys)

This is my personal website as seen at <https://adamhsparks.netlify.app/>.

The site is built with [{blogdown}](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and uses the lovely [hermit-v2](https://github.com/1bl4z3r/hermit-V2) theme by [lbl4z3r](https://github.com/1bl4z3r) with [customizations by me for the ORCID, Pixelfed, Keyoxide and Codeberg icons](https://github.com/adamhsparks/adamhsparks/blob/d9c391990fb79b2cf53e3a4f7e491e704e0b5ac1/layouts/partials/svg.html#L3C1-L15C7) from [Simpleicons.org](https://simpleicons.org/) and [Keyoxide.org](https://design.keyoxide.org/) with [custom colours](https://github.com/adamhsparks/adamhsparks/tree/main/assets/scss) from [Catppuccin Frappe](https://catppuccin.com/palette) with [Catppuccin Macchiato](https://catppuccin.com/palette) syntax highlighting.
