This is my personal website as seen at <https://adamhsparks.netlify.app/>.

The site is built with [{blogdown}](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and uses the lovely [hermit-v2](https://github.com/1bl4z3r/hermit-V2) them by [lbl4z3r](https://github.com/1bl4z3r) with [customizations by me for the ORCID, Pixelfed and Codeberg icons](https://github.com/adamhsparks/adamhsparks/blob/b952c50bfc51c79ead3d75e0d3e14935dbe73b73/layouts/partials/svg.html#L3-L7) from [Simpleicons.org](https://simpleicons.org/) and [custom colours](https://github.com/adamhsparks/adamhsparks/tree/main/assets/scss) from [Catppuccin Frappe](https://catppuccin.com/palette) with [Catppuccin Macchiato](https://catppuccin.com/palette) syntax highlighting.
