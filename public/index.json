The pathogen has a broad host-range of both monocot and dicot plant species which include numerous weed and crop plant species (1, 2). The disease is most commonly identified with summer crops, e.g. soybean, sorghum, sunflower, maize and mungbean (3) and occurs most often when hot, dry conditions occur during the growing season. Current estimates predict that north-eastern Australia will become hotter and dryer as a result of climate change (4, 5). Thus, it is likely that conditions favouring the development of this disease will become more common in the future. However, to date, no work has been done to determine the extent of the pathogen’s presence in Australian soils, in-paddock spatial variability, or the occurrence of the disease as correlated with pathogen presence and population levels. In this paper, we present findings from soil sampling and end-of-season disease assessments in sorghum paddocks across northern New South Wales (NNSW), south eastern Queensland (SEQ) and central Queensland (CQ) during the 2016/17 and 2017/18 summer cropping seasons.","tags":["Macrophomina","DAS00137","DAQ00186"],"title":"A broad look at charcoal rot in the Northern Region broadacre crops through soil sampling and in-crop surveys","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Adam H.

There is increasing interest in applying small scale models - e.g., based on tissue, organ or whole plants - using remotely collected daily data, to generate regional risk information (e.g., maps). The assumption made is that such small scale models “scale-up” appropriately to regional, continental or even global scale. However, these models are often constructed using locally collected, hourly data. By necessity data available are often at much coarser scale, both temporally and spatially, than the data used to develop the model. Computational requirements increase considerably when more detailed models that require fine resolution data (if available) are applied to large areas, while small scale models often add little useful information at these scales and may lead to error propagation. Ideally, detailed models should be used at small temporal and spatial scales and less detailed models used for larger temporal and spatial scales. This paper presents examples of different approaches for changing scales - including upscaling models, downscaling data, and developing new models - and the issues that these approaches create or solve, along with ideas about how we can ensure that the scale of model and data match the desired application.","tags":["Modelling","DAW00228"],"title":"Upscaling models, downscaling data or the right model for the right scale of application?","type":"talk"},{"authors":["A.

As the availability of data increases at scales from genomes to landscapes, our approaches now require even more diverse skills to collaborate and advance the field.

To support the adoption of these practices, we founded the Open Plant Pathology community (), which aims to foster relationships between researchers and promote open, transparent and reproducible research using shared data and reusable software, using R.
