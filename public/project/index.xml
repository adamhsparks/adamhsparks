      <description>This project is evaluating the potential environmental impact of rice production in North Queensland along with fertiliser practices that optimise yield while minimising environmental losses through advancements in: - Addressing key barriers to successful large scale rice production in Northern Australia in terms of pests, diseases and farming system management; - Identifying improved farming systems and rice varieties to lift northern rice yields; - Improving the skills of rice growers and research, development &amp;amp; extension staff in northern Australia through the development of agronomy packages and decision support tools.</description>
