Converting a relatively obscure GitHub Gist to a proper blog post.

There are still some sites that use FTP, not a more modern API or even just http(s).
I'm [looking at you BOM](http://www.bom.gov.au/catalogue/anon-ftp.shtml).
Sometimes it's useful to know what files are available on the server in you R session.

Using this code snippet you can easily get a list of files on the FTP server in your R session.

```{r get-ftp-file-list}
library(curl)

ftp_base <- "ftp://ftp.bom.gov.au/anon/gen/"
list_files <- curl::new_handle()
curl::handle_setopt(list_files, ftp_use_epsv = TRUE, dirlistonly = TRUE)

con <- curl::curl(url = ftp_base, "r", handle = list_files)
files <- readLines(con)
close(con)

files
```
