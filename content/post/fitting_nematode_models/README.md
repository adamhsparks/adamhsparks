This repository contains the Rmd file for the “Fitting Linear and
Quadratic Models of Nematode Population Responses to Time and
Temperature”.

The [Fitting\_Nematode\_Models.Rmd](Fitting_Nematode_Models.Rmd) file
contains the markdown, which was reviewed by
[@emdelponte](https://github.com/emdelponte) and
[@mladencucak](https://github.com/mladencucak)
to generate the content of the blog post.
