Analysis of plant pathogen pathotype survey data.  Functions   provided calculate distribution of susceptibilities, distribution of complexities with statistics, pathotype frequency distribution, as well as diversity indices for pathotypes.  This package is meant to be a direct replacement for the Habgood-Gilmour Spreadsheet, 'HaGiS', previously used for pathotype analysis.

See <https://openplantpathology.github.io/hagis/> for full documentation.
