<img style="float:right; margin:5px" src="logo.png">The GSOD or [Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD)](https://data.noaa.gov/dataset/dataset/global-surface-summary-of-the-day-gsod)
data provided by the US National Centers for Environmental Information
(NCEI) are a valuable source of weather data with global coverage.
However, the data files are cumbersome and difficult to work with.
_GSODR_ aims to make it easy to find, transfer and format the data you
need for use in analysis.

See <http://ropensci.github.io/GSODR/> for full documentation.
