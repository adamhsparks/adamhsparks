As a part of practicing open science and reproducible research, my software is available from GitHub, [@adamhsparks](//github.com/adamhsparks)

I've written and maintain several R packages available both on CRAN and GitHub.

### Weather or Climate Data Clients for R

* Australian weather from the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM), [bomrang](https://docs.ropensci.org/bomrang/)

* Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station Data (CHIRPS) API data client for R, [chirps](https://docs.ropensci.org/chirps/)

* NASA POWER Global Meteorology, Surface Solar Energy and Climatology Data Client for R, [nasapower](https://docs.ropensci.org/nasapower/)

* Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD) Weather Data Client for R, [GSODR](https://docs.ropensci.org/nasapower/)

* University of East Anglia Climate Research Unit (CRU) climate data, [getCRUCLdata](https://docs.ropensci.org/getCRUCLdata/)

### Plant Pathology Packages for R

* Analysis of plant pathogen pathotype complexities, distributions and diversity, [hagis](https://openplantpathology.github.io/hagis/)

### University of Southern Queensland (USQ) Styled Graphs for R

* USQ style typography, colours and graph themes for R, [theme.usq](https://adamhsparks.github.io/theme.usq/)

* USQ corporate presentation theme that incorporates theme.usq to make USQ style slides in R, [usq_xaringan](https://github.com/adamhsparks/usq_xaringan)
