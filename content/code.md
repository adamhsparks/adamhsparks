As a part of practising open science and reproducible research, my software is available from GitHub, [@adamhsparks](https://www.github.com/adamhsparks/).

I have written and maintain several R packages available both on CRAN and GitHub.

### Weather or Climate Data Clients for R

* [bomrang](https://docs.ropensci.org/bomrang/) - Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) weather data API Client for R

* [chirps](https://docs.ropensci.org/chirps/) - Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station Data (CHIRPS) API data client for R

* [getCRUCLdata](https://docs.ropensci.org/getCRUCLdata/) - University of East Anglia Climate Research Unit (CRU) climate data API client for R

* [GSODR](https://docs.ropensci.org/GSODR/) - Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD) Weather Data API Client for R

* [nasapower](https://docs.ropensci.org/nasapower/) - NASA POWER Global Meteorology, Surface Solar Energy and Climatology Data API Client for R

### Plant Pathology Packages for R

* [ascotraceR](https://ihsankhaliq.github.io/ascotraceR/) - A mechanistic model to simulate the spread of Ascochyta blight in a chickpea field

* [epicrop](http://adamhsparks.github.io/epicrop/) - Simulation modelling of crop diseases using a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model in R

* [hagis](https://openplantpathology.github.io/hagis/) - Analysis of plant pathogen pathotype complexities, distributions and diversity in R
