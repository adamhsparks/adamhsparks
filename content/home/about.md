# Biography

  I am a botanical epidemiologist and ecologist specialising in multivariate
  statistics, network analysis, geographic information systems (GIS) and
  simulation modeling. Currently I lead the summer crops pathology theme in the
  [Centre for Crop Health](https://www.facebook.com/CCHUSQ/)
  at the [University of Southern Queensland](https://www.usq.edu.au)
  researching integrated disease management of broadacre crops.
  
  Along with [Emerson Del Ponte](https://delpontelab.netlify.com), I co-founded
  [Open Plant Pathology](https://www.openplantpathology.org/), a community
  of modellers and computational researchers involved in plant pathology, plant
  disease epidemiology, pathogen population biology, microbial ecology and
  genomics, that supports the several forms of open science practices in plant
  pathology.
