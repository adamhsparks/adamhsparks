### GRDC Project: USQ1903

USQ is leading research into the risk of ascochyta blight in chickpea paddocks based on spore dispersal. [Dr Ihsan Khaliq](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ihsan_Khaliq3) is studying how far spores wind disperse and how much rainfall is necessary for dispersal to develop models to predict paddock risk to better inform agronomists and growers where it is safe to plant chickpeas.
