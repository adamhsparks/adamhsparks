This project is evaluating the potential environmental impact of rice production in North Queensland along with fertiliser practices that optimise yield while minimising environmental losses through advancements in:
  - Addressing key barriers to successful large scale rice production in Northern Australia in terms of pests, diseases and farming system management;
  - Identifying improved farming systems and rice varieties to lift northern rice yields;
  - Improving the skills of rice growers and research, development & extension staff in northern Australia through the development of agronomy packages and decision support tools.
