### GRDC Project: [DAQ00186](https://grdc.com.au/research/projects/project?id=603)

### Total Funding: $XXX,XXX

Integrated Disease Management (IDM) using various combinations of cultural, fungicide and resistance strategies offer the most viable long-term option for controlling the significant field crop diseases in the Northern Region. This project aims to build on the advances in IDM of major summer and winter crops made in the GRDC-funded project DAQ00154.

I lead the project at USQ in conjunction with Queensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries (QDAF) and work with New South Wales Department of Primary Industries (NSW-DPI), South Australia Research and Development Institute (SARDI) and Western Australia Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD) to meet project milestones.

Crops involved this project's research include<sup>*</sup>:

  - barley,

  - **chickpea**,

  - maize,

  - **mungbean**,

  - **peanut**,

  - **sorghum**,

  - **sunflower**,

  - wheat.

The main pathogens studied in this project include:

  - _Macrophomina phaseolina_ (charcoal rot),

  - _Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens_ pv. _flaccumfaciens_ (tan spot of mungbean),

  - _Pseudomonas savastonoi_ pv. _phaseolicola_ (halo blight of mungbean),

  - _Fusarium thapsinum_ and _F. andyazi_ (sorghum stalk rots),

  - _F. oxysporum_ and _F. solani_ (mungbean wilt),

  - _Phytophthora medacaginis_ (chickpea phytophthora root rot),

  - _Podosphara fusca_ (mungbean powdery mildew),

  - _Neocosmospora vasinfecta_ (peanut root rot),

  - _Diaporthe spp._ (stem cankers), and

  - _Tobacco Streak Virus_.

Project staff are involved in structured surveys across Queensland and northern New South Wales to collect data on what diseases are present in grain crops in the GRDC Northern Region in both winter and summer grains. [FulcrumApp](https://www.fulcrumapp.com/) is being used to collect data in these surveys.

Diagnostic services are offered to growers and agronomists through QDAF Toowoomba for disease and abiotic stress diagnostics.

Specific project milestones address priority diseases as identified by pathologists and the GRDC.

Work conducted in this project also contributed to [DAS00137](../das00137) and [DAW00228](../daw00228).

<sup>*</sup>Crops in bold are related to specific milestones in this project.
