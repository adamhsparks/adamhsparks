# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = "Soil-borne diseases cause significant and often unexpected yield losses in broadacre crops. Annual potential national losses in wheat from soil and stubble-borne pathogens have recently been estimated to exceed $1,060 million and $792 million, respectively. Most decisions to minimise the risk from soil-borne disease need to be made before seeding, but determining which diseases pose the greatest risk can be difficult, as pathogen levels respond to changes in climate variability, farm practices, cropping sequence and crop varieties. This project provides new tools to help growers reduce the losses due to soil borne diseases."

## Dates active: July 1, 2013 - June 30, 2019

### GRDC Project: [DAS00137](https://grdc.com.au/research/projects/project?id=667)

USQ contributed data this project for the development of new PredictaÂ®B tests. New tests for _Diaporthe spp._, _Macrophonmina phaseolina_, _Fusarium andyazi_ and F. _thapsinum_ were developed and tested in conjunction with SARDI. This work was conducted in cooperation with [DAQ00186](../daq00186).
