summary = "Models will be developed using up-to-date research findings and the best scientific procedures. Before the models are applied they will be tested with location-specific data. After testing they will be used to make decision-aiding tools to assist with farm management. The decision tools will be field tested with groups of potential users across the country."

### GRDC Project: [DAW00288](https://grdc.com.au/research/projects/project?id=784)

USQ contributed data this project for the development of a mungbean powdery mildew
decision support system (DSS) tool. Data were collected on the efficacy of fungicide timing on controlling the disease along with weather data for the development of the model and DSS. This work was conducted in cooperation with [DAQ00186](../daq00186).
